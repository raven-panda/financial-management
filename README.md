![made-by-me](https://github.com/raven-panda/ressources/blob/main/badges/made-by-me.svg)

The goal of this Angular project is to create an application where the user can manage their investments.

## Features

- **Investment Overview**: The main objective of this project is to allow users to manage their investments efficiently. You can visualize both your financial and real estate investments in one place.

- **Dashboard**: The homepage serves as a comprehensive dashboard that provides a summary of your investments. It includes two cards, one for real estate and one for financial investments. Each card displays the respective total investment amount and a graphical representation.

- **Investment Charts**: There are two types of graphical representations for your investments. For real estate investments, a bar chart is used to showcase the distribution of investments, and for financial investments, a donut chart demonstrates the allocation of funds (e.g., 70% in the current account, 20% in a savings account, and 10% in other investments).

- **Financial and Real Estate Pages**: The project includes separate pages for managing financial and real estate investments. These pages provide users with the ability to add new investment products and view detailed information about existing investments.
